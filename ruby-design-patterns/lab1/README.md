# Design Patterns - Creational Design Patterns

In this lab I first implemented the Abstract Factory in Ruby, following the UML Class diagram
from GoF, you can see it in the `gof_abstract_factory.rb` file.

Then I found the Ruby orthdox implementation of the Abstract Factory from [here](https://practicingruby.com/articles/creational-design-patterns).

And then, I also made all factories Singletones, because who needs many factories for the same families of classes? And then, as if that's not enough, I also added the Builder pattern, it's fluent incarnation (to be honest, the way it is done is quite... dirty, but hey, it seems like a Builder, so who cares?).

Enjoy.

Btw, I decided to go with Ruby because of it's true OOP-ness, and the feeling of Smalltalk + more career prospects for a new grad that it gives. Smalltalk is awesone. Ruby too.

Final note - Sorry for everything-in-a-single-file way of implementation, it hurts my eyes too, but I was in a hurry.
